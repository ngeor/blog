Back in March, I gave a presentation at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Delivery-Amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous Delivery Amsterdam meetup</a>. You can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSZEIDYCDug">here</a>. The title is "CD at scale: the success story of a big rewrite". It's about how we applied CD in a big project that involved complete rewrite of our storefronts at work.

<p>Short after releasing version 1.1.0, a new bug-fix version is been released.</p>
<p>What is fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FTP upload task should work again. Uploading would hang because the code wasn&#039;t closing the FTP stream properly.</li>
<li>The FTP upload task correctly supports single file upload.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is new:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new NAnt task, ftpDelete, that allows deleting a single file on an FTP server</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the latest version from the <a href="http://w3c-nant.sourceforge.net/">project&#039;s page on SourceForge</a>.</p>

<p>2017 is over! It's time for some graphs and numbers, looking back at the blog's stats for 2017.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Views</strong></p>
<p>Overall I had 13,934 views and 10,189 visitors.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018-01-01-10_31_36-stats-e280b9-ngeor-wordpress-com-e28094-wordpress-com.png" alt="2018-01-01 10_31_36-Stats ‹ ngeor.wordpress.com — WordPress.com.png" width="1042" height="341" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3552" /></p>
<p><strong>Top posts</strong></p>
<p>These were the top posts:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018-01-01-10_37_51-ngeor-wordpress-com-e28094-wordpress-com.png" alt="2018-01-01 10_37_51-ngeor.wordpress.com — WordPress.com.png" width="1040" height="633" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3553" /></p>
<p>The orange line means that these posts were written in 2017. What I find remarkable:</p>
<ul>
<li>the top post has twice the views compared to the second entry, which is actually not a post but the homepage of the blog</li>
<li>the post about the smashing dashboard is probably from people trying to repair an actual broken physical dashboard of some sort :)</li>
<li>the <code>ASP.NET</code> posts are inexplicably top on the list still</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top countries</strong></p>
<p>These were the top countries:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018-01-01-10_33_07-stats-e280b9-ngeor-wordpress-com-e28094-wordpress-com1.png" alt="2018-01-01 10_33_07-Stats ‹ ngeor.wordpress.com — WordPress.com.png" width="342" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3558" /></p>
<p>Greece is not in the top 10, I didn't expect that :)</p>
<p><strong>Top referrers</strong></p>
<p>Most people stumble upon the blog through search engines:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018-01-01-10_39_29-stats-e280b9-ngeor-wordpress-com-e28094-wordpress-com.png" alt="2018-01-01 10_39_29-Stats ‹ ngeor.wordpress.com — WordPress.com.png" width="342" height="427" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3555" /></p>
<p>and from these it's the social networks I share my posts on.</p>
<p>There are some referrers from a site called kubeweekly.com which mentioned my <a href="https://ngeor.wordpress.com/cd-with-helm/">CD with Helm series</a> in their weekly <a href="https://kubeweekly.com/kubeweekly-116/">Kubernetes updates</a>. I was definitely happy that someone other than me read these posts for a change :)</p>
<p>Drilling down the search engines, Google is the winner:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018-01-01-10_40_23-stats-e280b9-ngeor-wordpress-com-e28094-wordpress-com.png" alt="2018-01-01 10_40_23-Stats ‹ ngeor.wordpress.com — WordPress.com.png" width="341" height="355" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3556" /></p>
<p>I don't have insight to the search terms because Google is encrypting them for privacy reasons, according to <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/#search-engine-terms">Wordpress</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Best of wishes for 2018</strong> and I hope to find something interesting to blog about in the next year too!</p>

<p>This blog (and this site in general) has two nice image buttons at the end of the page, saying that the HTML and CSS are valid. Are they really?</p>
<p>Well I figured out several days ago that they weren&#039;t valid. I must&#039;ve been really bored and I actually clicked the images. Both the HTML and the CSS were invalid. Today I had some time to fix this.</p>
<p>The HTML is now again valid. The tiny problem was caused by BlogEngine itself: an ampersand wasn&#039;t encoded. I&#039;m now using a modified dll and I submitted <a href="http://blogengine.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/Forks/NikolaosGeorgiou/MinifyJavascriptInvalidHTML" target="_blank">my code changes</a> (all 4 keystrokes of them) to their source code where they&#039;re waiting to be approved.</p>
<p>As for the CSS, I think the W3C validator has some bug. It chokes on the border-radius property, which is valid CSS3. I see that some other person has <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=11975" target="_blank">already filed this as a bug</a> last week, so I guess I&#039;ll just have to wait.</p>
<p>In any case, I think it&#039;s interesting to explore how this validation can become a part of the build process; otherwise you just have two images there that don&#039;t mean anything. I didn&#039;t find anything ready on the web so I created it myself: NAnt tasks that use the W3C online validation services to validate urls of a site.</p>
<p>The project is called <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/w3c-nant/" target="_blank">w3c-nant</a> and it contains a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/w3c-nant/files/v1.0.0/W3CValidationTasks.dll/download" target="_blank">single dll with two NAnt tasks</a>: validateHtml and validateCss. The names are self descriptive I think. To use them, first copy the dll into the bin folder of NAnt. In your NAnt build file you can now write instructions like:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
&lt;validateHtml url=&quot;http://www.mysite.com/&quot; /&gt;<br />
&lt;validateCss url=&quot;http://www.mysite.com/&quot; /&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Note that by default the build will fail if the W3C reports validation errors. If you don&#039;t want that to happen, you can set the attribute failonerror to false:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
&lt;validateHtml url=&quot;http://www.mysite.com&quot; failonerror=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>NAnt will then consider this a non-fatal error: it will be logged as an error but the build will still be successful.</p>
<p>Also, these tasks will only validate the url that they are given; they don&#039;t perform any crawling of any kind. So they don&#039;t guarantee that 100% of the site&#039;s pages are valid. My suggestion is to use a few urls that you think are representative enough - or you can write some crawler task and integrate it with the validator :-)</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

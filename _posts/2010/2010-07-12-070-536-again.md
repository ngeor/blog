Today I took <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010/2010-06-25-certification-nightmare %}">again</a> the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-536">070-536 exam</a> and I passed it once more, this time with an even higher score (861, while the previous time I had scored 838 points). I'm crossing my fingers that this time the testing center will not go bankrupt... hopefully within a few days I will get a notification from Microsoft verifying that I passed the exam. In combination with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-528">070-528</a> that I had passed on March, I should now have the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcts.aspx#tab2">MCTS .NET 2.0 Web Applications certification</a>, which is my first certification!

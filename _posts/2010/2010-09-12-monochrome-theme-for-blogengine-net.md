A couple of weeks I started porting the
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/monochrome" target="_blank">Monochrome</a>
theme by <a href="http://www.mono-lab.net/" target="_blank">mono-lab</a> to the
BlogEngine.NET platform. It's quite tricky to port it because of the limitations
on the things you can control by a BlogEngine.NET theme. Today I spent some more
time and I made some good progress. It's not ready yet but you can have a look
at it.

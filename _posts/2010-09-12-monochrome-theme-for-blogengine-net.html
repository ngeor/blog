<p>A couple of weeks I started porting the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/monochrome" target="_blank">Monochrome</a> theme by <a href="http://www.mono-lab.net/" target="_blank">mono-lab</a> to the BlogEngine.NET platform. It&#039;s quite tricky to port it because of the limitations on the things you can control by a BlogEngine.NET theme. Today I spent some more time and I made some good progress. It&#039;s not ready yet but you can have a look at it.</p>

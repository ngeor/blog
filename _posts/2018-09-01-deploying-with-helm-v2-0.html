<p>In the series with Helm and Continuous Delivery nine months ago, I used <a href="https://ngeor.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/cd-with-helm-part-5-versioned-artifacts/">helm to deploy the application to the kubernetes cluster</a>. To be able to do that from the CI server, I had to make a workaround. I had punched a hole in the cluster with a NodePort service for Tiller. This allows pretty much anyone to reach Tiller (the server side component of Helm) and interact with it. Great for a demo blog post, but not so great for security.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here is a different way to reach Tiller. Helm works with the same configuration of kubectl. That configuration is in the <code>~/.kube/config</code> file. We can copy the contents of that file, base64 encode it, and store it in a secure environment variable in the CI server. During deployment, we can do the reverse: base64 decode the variable and write it into the file where kubectl and Helm expect it.</p>
<p>One small caveat is that the file might contain references to other files and certificates. To avoid dealing with multiple files, kubectl offers a handy command that exports the entire configuration as a single file: <code>kubectl config view --flatten</code></p>
<p>Together with base64, in a bash command line (with <code>-w0</code> to avoid issues with new lines):</p>
<p>[code]<br />
kubectl config view --flatten | base64 -w0<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Copy paste that value and save it in the CI server as a secure environment variable under the name <code>KUBECTL_CONFIG</code> (or any other name you like).</p>
<p>And in the deployment script, you can use it like this:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
mkdir -p ~/.kube<br />
base64 -d "$KUBECTL_CONFIG" &gt; ~/.kube/config<br />
[/code]</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you want to force Windows Live Photo Gallery to rebuild its database, you can just delete the folder where it stores its settings. The folder location is:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
%userprofile%AppDataLocalMicrosoftWindows Live Photo Gallery<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>after deleting this, it will rebuild thumbnails, read metadata, perform face recognition, the whole thing.</p>

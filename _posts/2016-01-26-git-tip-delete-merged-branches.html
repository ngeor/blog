<p>If you want to delete your local branches that have already been merged to master remotely, run this in a bash shell:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
$ git branch -D `git branch --merged | grep -v '*' | xargs`<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This deletes all branches that are merged, except the currently checked out branch (that's the part with the start). So you should better run this <strong>while you've got the master branch checked out</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2018-08-25</strong>: Powershell equivalent:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>PS&gt; git branch --merged | ? { $_ -notmatch '\*' } | ForEach-Object { git branch -d $_.Trim() }</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>A different way for bash:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>$ git branch --merged | grep -v '*' | xargs git branch -d</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Note that if you squash &amp; merge (a popular option in GitHub and Bitbucket), then <code>git branch --merged</code> will not return these branches. In that case, try <code>git branch -l</code> but with the extra risk you might delete a branch you were still working on.</p>

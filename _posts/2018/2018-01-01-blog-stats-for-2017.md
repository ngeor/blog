2017 is over! It's time for some graphs and numbers, looking back at the blog's
stats for 2017.

## Views

Overall I had 13,934 views and 10,189 visitors.

## Top posts

These were the top posts:

The orange line means that these posts were written in 2017. What I find
remarkable:

<ul>
<li>the top post has twice the views compared to the second entry, which is actually not a post but the homepage of the blog</li>
<li>the post about the smashing dashboard is probably from people trying to repair an actual broken physical dashboard of some sort :)</li>
<li>the <code>ASP.NET</code> posts are inexplicably top on the list still</li>
</ul>

## Top countries

These were the top countries:

Greece is not in the top 10, I didn't expect that :)

## Top referrers

Most people stumble upon the blog through search engines:

and from these it's the social networks I share my posts on.

There are some referrers from a site called kubeweekly.com which mentioned my
<a href="{% link _series/2017-12-09-cd-with-helm.md %}">CD with Helm series</a> in their
weekly <a href="https://kubeweekly.com/kubeweekly-116/">Kubernetes updates</a>.
I was definitely happy that someone other than me read these posts for a change
:)

Drilling down the search engines, Google is the winner:

I don't have insight to the search terms because Google is encrypting them for
privacy reasons, according to
<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/#search-engine-terms">Wordpress</a>.

<strong>Best of wishes for 2018</strong> and I hope to find something
interesting to blog about in the next year too!

<p>A new version for w3c-nant was released today. What is new in this version:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project is now targeting .NET 4 instead of .NET 3.5. That is the reason why this version is 1.1.0 and not 1.0.3.</li>
<li>There are now two DLLs, W3CValidationTasks.dll and a new one called W3CValidationTasks.Core.dll. The new DLL contains most of the logic but without requiring NAnt. The old DLL is now a thinner layer, exposing that logic as NAnt tasks.</li>
<li>A bug was fixed in the ftpUpload task, where uploading would fail if the target folder didn&#039;t already exist. Now the ftpUpload task will first ensure that the necessary folders exist (or otherwise it will create them) and then it will upload the files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the latest version from the <a href="http://w3c-nant.sourceforge.net/">project&#039;s page on SourceForge</a>.</p>

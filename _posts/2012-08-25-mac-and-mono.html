<p>Some random steps on getting my Mac up to speed with Mono development.</p>
<h3>Versions</h3>
<p>I tried to download the latest MonoDevelop (3.0.3.5) but apparently it doesn&#039;t work anymore on Mac OS X Leopard, so, after <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10590268/how-to-download-older-version-of-monodevelop">searching a bit</a>, I used a <a href="http://download.xamarin.com/monodevelop/Mac/MonoDevelop-2.8.8.4.dmg">previous edition</a> (2.8.8.4).</p>
<p>The latest Mono version however works fine (2.10.9_11).</p>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>When I run a GTK app through MonoDevelop, it runs fine. When I tried via the command line, it crashed complaining it couldn&#039;t find glibsharpglue-2. The problem here was with missing environment variables. I modified /etc/profile like this (<strong>the second and third line are supposed to be on the same line without the dots, I only broke it down to fit the page</strong>):</p>
<p>[code]<br />
export MONO_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current<br />
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="$MONO_FRAMEWORK_PATH/lib:...<br />
...$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:/lib:/usr/lib"<br />
[/code]</p>
<h3>MonoMac</h3>
<p>I created a blank MonoMac application and it would work great but when I tried to open it from Finder it said that this application isn&#039;t compatible with my Mac. The problem was that the application template sets a minimum version requirement to 10.6 (Snow Leopard). The solution is to modify Info.plist and set the value of the key LSMinimumSystemVersion to 10.5. Then it works fine also on Leopard.</p>
<h3>Automatic build and TeamCity</h3>
<p>Building through xbuild from the command line doesn&#039;t seem to work for MonoMac projects. It complains it can&#039;t import some Mono.MonoMac.targets. I used mdtool instead, it&#039;s MonoDevelop&#039;s command line tool. I created a build configuration in TeamCity with the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runner Type: Command Line</li>
<li>Command executable: /Applications/MonoDevelop.app/Contents/MacOS/mdtool</li>
<li>Command parameters: build MySolution.sln</li>
</ul>
<p>I also set-up an explicit agent requirement to only allow this build to be run on a Mac (otherwise even my Windows agent would be compatible):</p>
<ul>
<li>system.os.name contains Mac OS X</li>
</ul>
<p>The final step is to get the artifacts. The MonoMac project MyProject, if it builds successfully, it creates a Mac application in the bin/Debug folder. The Mac app is essentially another folder with a special structure and a .app file extension. So what I want is to package that folder in a zip file. To achieve that, I set up the following artifact mapping:</p>
<ul>
<li>MyProject/bin/Debug/MyProject.app =&gt; MyProject.zip/MyProject.app</li>
</ul>
<p>When the build is complete, I can download the entire app as a zip file. Double clicking that zip file gives me the app, which I can run or drag into the Applications folder of my Mac. Notice the right side of the artifact mapping, it also references the folder MyProject.app. If you don&#039;t include that, the root folder of the app will be missing and after expanding the zip file the contents won&#039;t be recognized as an app by Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

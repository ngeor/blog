<p>Yesterday I played a bit with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoMac" target="_blank">MonoMac</a>, a new framework for Mono that you can use in order to create .NET applications that have a native look and feel in Mac OS X. I have never done any Mac related development in the past so I had to read up on how Apple builts its UIs. My experiments made their way to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/resxtranslator/" target="_blank">ResxTranslator</a>'s code base, so I intend that ResxTranslator will have three separate UIs: WinForms, GTK# and now Cocoa via MonoMac!<!--more--></p>
<p>In order to play with MonoMac you'll have to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get and compile the code from modules <a href="https://github.com/mono/maccore" target="_blank">maccore</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mono/monomac" target="_blank">monomac</a>. They should end up in directories on the same level, so there should be a parent folder containing folders maccore and monomac. Then, from the folder monomac simply run make. In a terminal you could type something like this:
<p>[code]<br />
git clone https://github.com/mono/monomac.git<br />
git clone https://github.com/mono/maccore.git<br />
cd monomac<br />
make<br />
[/code]</p>
</li>
<li>Add a repository in MonoDevelop: http://addins.monodevelop.com/Alpha/Mac/2.4/main.mrep<a href="https://ngeor.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/repository.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/repository.png?w=300" alt="repository" width="300" height="107" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-202" /></a></li>
<li>A new add-in will be available: MonoMac development under category Mac Development<a href="https://ngeor.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/addin.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/addin.png?w=300" alt="addin" width="300" height="241" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-503" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>MonoMac is not done yet, so I had some problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Info.plist file specifies the minimum OS version to 10.6, but I still use Leopard so my app wouldn't run. I had to manually change the number to 10.5.</li>
<li>MonoDevelop cannot launch the application, complaining that there's no Info.plist file: "No Info.plist file in application bundle or no NSPrincipalClass in the Info.plist file, exiting". The only workaround I found by experimenting was to switch to the folder "bin/Debug/ResxTranslatorMac.app/Contents/MacOS" and from there launch the executable. Then the application will launch.</li>
<li>Sometimes, the application would crash with this message: "Non-aligned pointer being freed". Pretty scary for somebody who's been coding without worrying about memory management and pointers for a very long time! I guess it's something the MonoMac team is working on?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's very nice to see that you can code a Mac OS X app without needing to learn Objective C. I hope that MonoMac will soon be a standard add-in in MonoDevelop.</p>

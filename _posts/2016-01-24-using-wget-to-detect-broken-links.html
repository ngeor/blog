<p>To make sure I didn't forget any images in the <a href="http://ngeor.net/2016/01/migrated-back-to-wordpress/">blog migration</a>, I used wget to detect broken links. Better safe than sorry! Simply run:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
wget -r -nv --spider http://ngeor.net/ -o log.txt<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And you get the report of the broken links in log.txt.</p>
<p>Turns out I had to adjust a couple of permalinks after all.</p>
<p>If you're on a Mac, use HomeBrew to install wget.</p>

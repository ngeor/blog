<p>It&#039;s amazing when you work for many many years with a technology and stumble upon something new. I stumbled upon an HTML tag that I had never used before, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#h-9.2.2" target="_blank">Q tag</a>.</p>
<p>With the Q tag, you can quote some text inside a paragraph without breaking the line. The browser is supposed to render that text in quotes, so you don&#039;t have to add them yourself.</p>
<p>Let&#039;s see it in action:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
&lt;p&gt;Quoting with the Q tag is &lt;q&gt;sweet&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>The above HTML snippet will render like this:</p>
<p>Quoting with the Q tag is <q>sweet</q>.</p>
<p>And with CSS you can style just the Q tag, making for example all of your quoted text also bold or italics. Of course you could do the same thing by misusing some span or em tag, possibly with a separate CSS class name, but I think this approach is cleaner and more semantic friendly.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

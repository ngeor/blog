<p>I did the following changes to my DOSBox configuration file:</p>
<ul>
<li>fulldouble=true (it probably doesn't hurt, it's supposed to reduce flickering)</li>
<li>windowresolution=1900x1024 (because on my high DPI laptop screen DOSBox by default launches in a teeny tiny window I can barely read)</li>
<li>output=opengl (works in combination with the previous setting)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the autoexec section, these two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>mount c c:\users\ngeor\dosbox</li>
<li>c:</li>
</ul>
<p>This mounts my dosbox folder as the C drive and switches to that drive, so I'm ready to launch GWBasic :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

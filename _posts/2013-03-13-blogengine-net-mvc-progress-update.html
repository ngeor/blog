<p>Here&#039;s a short update on what I&#039;ve been working on. Time is a bit limited but I like to hack around in this project and that&#039;s what it&#039;s all about!</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented Category and Tag pages</li>
<li>Initial implementation for RSS feed</li>
<li>Showing comments in the post page</li>
<li>Implemented Add, Edit, Delete, Restore and Purge actions for Posts and Pages</li>
<li>Started working on a blog settings page</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#039;m thinking of perhaps setting up an issue tracker to maintain a log of what needs to be done and what has already been done. I don&#039;t think I can do that in CodePlex, because that would have to be a tracker just for my branch and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s supported. Or maybe set up some rough goals like milestones of the project. I&#039;ll see how it goes...</p>
<p>One comment on the Restore and Purge actions: in BlogEngine.NET, when you delete a post or a page it doesn&#039;t get completely deleted. It is marked as deleted, but the post file is still there (if you&#039;re using the default file based storage). To really delete it, you need to empty the recycle bin in the admin UI. I have taken a different approach in the pages that show lists of posts (homepage, category page, tag page, etc):</p>
<ul>
<li>you see all the posts (or pages) you&#039;re allowed to based on your permissions</li>
<li>that includes deleted posts too!</li>
<li>unpublished and deleted items are presented with a small text label that indicates their status</li>
</ul>
<p>I find this view a bit simpler, at least for now... of course the recycle bin concept is probably better (you delete a post for a reason, you don&#039;t want to see it in your face all the time) but that will come later.</p>
<p>Things to come up next:</p>
<ul>
<li>pagination for homepage and similar pages</li>
<li>submitting comments</li>
<li>uploading images to a post (I want to use <a href="http://imageresizing.net/">ImageResizing.Net</a> here)</li>
<li>implement contact form</li>
<li>implement blog settings page (only settings that are used).</li>
<li>support markdown formatting in posts and pages</li>
</ul>
<p>and more, much more!</p>

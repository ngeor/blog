<h3>Suitsupply / Technology Lead</h3>

<small>September 2017 - January 2018</small>

<p>Worked with the webshop team in the Salesforce Commerce Cloud (formerly known as Demandware)

<h3>BESTSELLER / Lead Software Architect</h3>

<small>January 2015 - July 2017</small>

<p>Initially involved with BESTSELLER as external consultant, after
BESTSELLER moved from Aarhus to Amsterdam, I was offered the role of
the architect. Demandware development, migration from svn to git,
automating manual tasks and thinking about systems' responsibilities
and what can be done better.</p>

<p>Mid-late 2015, the big rewrite of our websites. As the architect, I was
responsible for coordinating the project from a technical point of view in
every phase, from design until implementation. Coached developers
about best practices not often used in the Demandware ecosystem but
also making sure they deliver work according to our high standards.
Developed the continuous delivery pipeline, from writing the code until
deploying to production, working around inherent limitations of the
Demandware platform. Static code analysis, unit tests, integration tests,
code coverage, all with the new Demandware JavaScript controllers
engine.</p>

<p>JavaScript, nodeJS, mocha, istanbul, grunt, webdriverIO, ESLint, CI/CD,
Jenkins, Bamboo Cloud, TeamCity, best practices, mentoring junior/medior developers.</p>

<p>Having successfully lead the technical effort of stabilizing the
frontend, I was transferred to the backend team to repeat the
challenge there. Gave team focus and technical guidance to make
the right decisions. Created technical roadmap and cataloged
technical debt for dealing with legacy monolith application.
Microservices design and CI best practices. Organized hackathon
sessions to build up team knowledge levels.</p>

SNS, AWS SQS, Apache Kafka.</p>

## Own your photos

<div class="hero__right" markdown="1">
The cloud is everywhere. Photos and videos float from your Android phone into
the ubiquitous electronic nebulae and are accessible on any device at the tip of your
fingers. But what if you want to copy and backup your photos on your computer? What if
you want to organize them by year or month? Enter photonext.

## Ignore what you don't want

By default, photonext will discover and import all photos and videos from your
phone or tablet. You can skip the folders you don't care about (e.g. thumbnails,
animated GIFs). photonext remembers your selection per device.

## Configurable rename pattern

<div class="hero__right" markdown="1">

By default, photonext will import your photos and videos with their original
filename. It is possible however to rename them automatically based on the date
they were taken. A date-time based filename can make organization more
efficient.

photonext does not impose its own date-time pattern but allows you to choose
your own. For example, you can use `yyyy-MM-dd HHmmss.ext` or `dd_MM_yyyy.ext`
as you wish. photonext remembers your preference so you only have to set this
once.

## Organize into folders

By default, photonext will copy your photos to your Pictures folder. It is
possible to pick a different folder, but what is more interesting is the ability
to automatically import your photos and videos into subfolders based on the date
they were taken.

It is possible to create a separate folder per year or, if you prefer, drill
down to a separate subfolder per year and then per month.

## Troubleshooting

Each device is different. If you experience issues importing, you can try the
following:

- Make sure your device (phone, tablet, etc) is connected to your computer
- Make sure your device is connected as an MTP device:

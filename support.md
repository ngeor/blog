Hello there!

You probably ended up here after reading one of my blog posts. Or maybe you are
coming from one of my [code repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/ngeor). I
hope you found the content (or code) useful in some way. If you did, and you
would like to support me, here's a couple of ways you can do that.

## Sharing

Sharing is caring. If you read a blog post that you liked, feel free to share it
on your social media. Same for any code repository you might find interesting.
You can also star it on GitHub to show your appreciation!

## Feedback

Have you found a mistake somewhere? Perhaps something else that is not clear or
could be improved? Don't hesitate to reach out on
[my Twitter](https://twitter.com/ngeor). Sometimes the best way to support me is
with your feedback.

## Donate

Last but not least, you can show your appreciation by donating any small amount.

You can use PayPal:
